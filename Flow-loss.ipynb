This will depend on the query optimizer - in particular the properties of the cost model we choose, and the search function etc. We provide implementations for the two options as discussed in the paper, but by changing configurations of the PostgreSQL cost model, or adding more complex custom cost models, there can be many possibilities considered here.\n",
